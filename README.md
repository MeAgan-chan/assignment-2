MedAid
This project will allow users to find articles about various illnesses and diseases as well as find hospitals and polyclinics around them. This project is directed to the general public who want to know more about the possible diseases prevalant in their lives, as well as just to be knowledgable about the healthsites around them.(The term "healthsites" is used to describe clinics, polyclinics and hospitals alike.) This website will 'aid' people in their understanding of illnesses that they could get and how they can prevent themselves from getting said illnesses.
In addition to finding healthsites around the user, they will also know the price range of them. the price range would be based of just a general consultation for walk-in illnesses (ie. flu, fever), excluding special cases like gynacologist services and cancer treatment.

Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

As a patient, I want to know more about the hospitals and clinics near me, so that I can find medical attention quickly when I need it. As a patient of a lower Social-Economical Status, I want to know the price range of the healthsites that are near me, so that I not only know the healthsites around me but also the most affordable healthsite to go to. As a person with no particular illnesses, I want to know more about the illnesses I could get, so that I could prevent the possibilities of getting that said illness,

Features
After leaving the start page, the user can either access the map or the medical articles. The map will allow users to see all of Singapore's hospitals, clinics and polyclinics. You can also check the price-range of each healthsite when selecting on the locations. From the medical articles, users can look through articles of various illnesses, as well as search for soecific illnesses to look up on.

Features Left to Implement / Additional features
I wish for this project to be world-wide instead of just situated in Singapore, as the knowledge of illnesses should be prevalant among everyone regardless of nationality. Because of this I need to get the price range of all healthsites out of Singapore as well.
I would also want doctors and medical specialists to be able to host forums in which users may ask questions and they will answer.
This could be done by having a "sign-in" function where users can either sign in as a patient or a specialist. This would also require legitamate autorization on the specialist's part.
Due to lack of time and resources, the price-range of healthsites has not become an existing feature.
